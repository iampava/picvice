# picvice
Progressive Web App &amp; Hybrid App built with Ionic 2 to showcase the framework and it's features.

## Info
This repo has 3 branches with the following purpose

**master** - contains the [hybrid app] (http://developer.telerik.com/featured/what-is-a-hybrid-mobile-app/ "What are hybrid apps?") code which allows this Ionic 2 project to run on android, mobile or windows phone

**progressive-web-app**: contains the [progressive web-app] (https://addyosmani.com/blog/getting-started-with-progressive-web-apps/ "Progressive Web Apps") code which uses [Service Workers] (https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers "Service Workers") for an offline experience.. Since Ionic 2 is a Front-End framework there's nothing stopping us from deploying it online.

**gh-pages**: contains the same functionality as in the **progressive-web-app** branch. Why do I still have it here? So that you can access the project [online](http://pafcal.github.io/picvice "Picvice")
## Run the project

1. **npm install**
2. **ionic serve**

**[Live demo] (http://pafcal.github.io/picvice "Picvice")** - try it from a mobile device for a full experience
